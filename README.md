# Project Title

Open Source Automated Sheet Resistance Measurement equipment. This repository contains the GUI Java Software and Arduino firmware for Teensy 3.2. More information and links coming next.

## Getting Started

Don't forget to add opencsv-3.8.jar, sp-core.jar, and sp-tty.jar in Java Build Path when building the project. Alternatively just run OS4PP.jar.

### Prerequisites

All required libraries is already included in the folder. 


### Installing

Use Arduino IDE to download the firmware into Teensy 3.2 board. Connect the Teensy 3.2 via USB cable and start OS4PP.jar in Java folder
